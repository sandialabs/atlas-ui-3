# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived versions of documentation files that have been superseded by newer, more organized versions.

## November 2025 - Documentation Reorganization

The following files were split into topic-based guides for better organization and maintainability:

- **01_getting_started.md** → See [../getting-started/](../getting-started/)
- **02_admin_guide.md** → See [../admin/](../admin/)
- **03_developer_guide.md** → See [../developer/](../developer/)

The new structure organizes documentation by topic, making it easier to find specific information and maintain the docs as the project evolves.

## Current Documentation

For current documentation, please refer to:

- [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/README.md)
- [Administrator's Guide](../admin/README.md)
- [Developer's Guide](../developer/README.md)
